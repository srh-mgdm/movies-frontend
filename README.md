MOVIES is a website that allows you to display the latest released movies with the ability to create a wishlist, add a view counter, and rate each of the presented films. The unique feature of this app is that it is developed using React! (using 'props' and 'Inverse Data Flow' to tranfer the data between parent and child components).
Thanks to effect hooks, we will be able to load the list of the latest movies suggested by the API and display them on our website.
